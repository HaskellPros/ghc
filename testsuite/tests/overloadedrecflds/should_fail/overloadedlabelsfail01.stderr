    • Ambiguous type variable ‘t0’ arising from the overloaded label ‘#x’
      prevents the constraint ‘(IsLabel "x" t0)’ from being solved.
      Relevant bindings include
        a :: t0 (bound at overloadedlabelsfail01.hs:6:1)
      Probable fix: use a type annotation to specify what ‘t0’ should be.
      These potential instance exist:
        instance GHC.Records.HasField x r a => IsLabel x (r -> a)
          -- Defined in ‘GHC.OverloadedLabels’
    • In the expression: #x
      In an equation for ‘a’: a = #x
